Building Your Own Package
=========================

Building your own DMS package is similar to building a normal application.
You must define your entities, mappers and modules.

Then you must [create a composer package](http://www.darwinbiler.com/creating-composer-package-library/)
so it can be installed in other projects.

For a complete example of a working package, including tests, see the [blog package](https://github.com/dms-org/package.blog).
